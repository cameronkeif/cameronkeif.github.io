        <h2>November 27 2018 - React Hooks</h2>

        <p>
          Since ReactConf 2018, a big amount of buzz in the React community has been around hooks.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what are React hooks? This is a new feature proposal live in React v16.7.0-alpha. There is an <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/68">open RFC</a> where discussion of the full implementation is taking place.  React hooks basically allow you to use state and other React features (such as lifecycle methods)
          without needing to create a new class. This leads to easily reusable code and makes it easier to write pure components instead of new classes. An overview can be found <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html">here.</a>
        </p>

        <b><u>The Effect Hook</u></b>

        <p>
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#%EF%B8%8F-effect-hook">The Effect Hook</a> allows us to reuse logic in the React lifecycle methods. 
          Think of it as <span class="inline-code">componentDidMount</span>, <span class="inline-code">componentDidUpdate</span>, and <span class="inline-code">componentWillUnmount</span> all in one. For example, maybe
          I want to do something like make an API call and update some output <span class="inline-code">div</span> every time I hit <span class="inline-code">componentDidMount</span> or <span class="inline-code">componentDidUpdate</span>. The Effect Hook allows us to remove a lot of that boilerplate.
        </p>

    Currently that might look something like this:

        <div class="code">
          <pre>
            <code>
  // Note: obviously this isn't a great real world scenario -- but it's a good educational one :)
  class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      api.get('somePath')
        .then((result) => {
          document.getElementById('result-output').innerHTML = result;
        });
    }

    componentDidUpdate() {
      api.get('somePath')
        .then((result) => {
          document.getElementById('result-output').innerHTML = result;
        });
    }
  }
          </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

    But with the <span class="inline-code">useEffect</span> hook, we can just do this:

        <div class="code">
            <pre>
              <code>
  const MyComponent = (props) => {
    useEffect(() =>{
      api.get('somePath')
        .then((result) => {
          document.getElementById('result-output').innerHTML = result;
        });
    });
  }
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>

        <p>
        Both of these components achieve the same effect of updating the document title on initial load and when the component updates, but the latter with the hook is more succinct and easier to understand. It's possible to share logic
        like this today by writing another method, but with <span class="inline-code">useEffect</span> this becomes even simpler and cleaner.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <b><u>The State Hook</u></b>

      <p>
          Another really nice hook is <span class="inline-code">useState</span>. This will allow us to initialize the value of some piece of state, and create a function to update that state as a one-liner:
        </p>

        <div class="code">
            <pre>
              <code>
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>

        This creates a piece of state called <span class="inline-code">isLoading</span>, and initializes it to <span class="inline-code">false</span>.
        It also creates a function called <span class="inline-code">setIsLoading</span> which is effectively the same as:

        <div class="code">
            <pre>
              <code>
  this.setState({ isLoading: value })
            </code>
          </pre>
        </div>

      Overall this is not exactly game-changing, but again, it's definitely a cleaner way to declare state and manage it. I am curious how this will work 
      if you need to update multiple pieces of state in a single operation, but I may just need to do some research. We definitely wouldn't want to cause a re-render for each individual piece of state.
      That said, I don't think it needs to be one or the other, it may be that we use these setter functions for situations where only one piece of state is modified and use the good ol' fashioned <span class="inline-code">this.setState</span>
      function for cases where we need multiple pieces of state updated in a single operation.

      <b><u>Custom Hooks</u></b>

        <p>
          There are several other out of box hooks available, but what I'm most interested in is Custom Hooks. With Custom Hooks developers will be able to write their own hooks to share stateful logic between components. This to me is far and away the biggest benefit of Hooks. 
          Being able to share commonly used state will allow developers to write pure components much more easily, which cuts down on boilerplate code and makes components much more predictable.
        </p>
        
          <p>
          For example, a common pattern I find myself writing is flags maintained in component/redux state indicating "<span class="inline-code">isLoading</span>", "<span class="inline-code">isBeingCreated</span>", "<span class="inline-code">isBeingEdited</span>", etc. With a custom Hook
          I could abstract that out to a custom Hook and remove that logic from all those individual components. This is powerful, but with great power comes great responsibility as I could see these Custom Hooks being very prone to bad spaghetti code.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <p>
          Overall, I think hooks are an excellent addition to React, but I think they need to be managed carefully. I would not consider them a necessary future necessity for good React code, but rather
          another tool for our toolbox where and when it makes sense. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The native out of box hooks like <span class="inline-code">useEffect</span> and <span class="inline-code">useState</span> seem very simple to use, 
          but the biggest place I can see problems arising is with Custom Hooks. As long as they are clearly documented and well designed/implemented,  I think they can be
          quite powerful. Hooks are definitely something I look forward to experimenting with, but I certainly will not be rushing to add them to any production code for awhile.
