        <h2>January 10 2019 - Memoizing Functions</h2>

        <p>
            Recently I had to implement something at my job which involved determining if a UUID was contained somewhere in a big set of JSON.
            I know that's not very descriptive, but you know I can't be giving away that secret sauce ;). During code review, it was suggested that I memoize
            this function. This drastically improved performance on something that would be called many, many times. I had forgotten about memoization 
            and how useful that can be situationally, so I thought this would be a good quick topic to write about!
        </p>

        <p>
            So what does it mean to "memoize" a function? Memoization means that we store the results of an expensive function, and if the same input is provided
            we just return the original value. If that function is called with a set of arguments that are cached, we do not need to execute the code at all, 
            we can just go ahead and return the old value. So if your function involves iterating over an unchanged array of 300 elements, rather than 
            N * 300 operations, or O(N) operations, you end up with 300 iterations + a cache lookup, which is drastically faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, this was particularly helpful. The JSON was parsed into an object beforehand, but still required a little bit of iteration and diving into the body
          to find the particular values being examined. While the code could have been cleaned up a bit so only the relevant bit was maintained in state, I've found it
          is often useful to keep the full payload somewhere in state as it's very likely you'll be using other parts of it very soon (otherwise why would they be in there?)
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a good, simple explanation of how one might write a memoized function in JavaScript 
          <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-memoize-in-javascript-51d07d19430e"> here</a>, but I found the library
          <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/memoizee">memoizee</a> to be great for most cases, as it abstract all the cache management away.
          For custom caching logic or advanced cases, you might need some good ol' elbow grease, but in most cases I think a library like this suffices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely, there are plenty of other solutions out there to handle situations like this. Maybe you could massage the API reponse into a more digestable
          data structure. Maybe you could use something like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/reselect">reselect</a>. But, for a nice quick way
          to improve performance on something that is called many times with the same arguments, consider giving memoization a shot!
