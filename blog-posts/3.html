        <h2>May 8 2019 - Short-lived Data and Caching</h2>
        <p>
            Something I have recently learned to use at work is a nifty little persistence tool called <a href="https://memcached.org/">memcached</a>.
            Memcached is a "distributed memory object caching system". In other words, it's essentially a giant key-value pair store. What, you thought
            all I did was front-end? I <b>am</b> full stack ;). Regardless I had never really thought about this before, after all, what's wrong with good ol' fashioned databases?
        </p>
        <p>
            Tools like memcached allow you to store ephemeral data in a very performant way and not have to worry about storing a bunch of data that isn't used anymore.
            You definitely wouldn't want to store things like users or some resource that's long lived, but for things like a one-time password code or any other data that
            wouldn't matter after a short amount of time, memcached is a pretty cool solution. You can also put it on top of a frequently read table as, you know... a cache.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memcached allows you to configure how long you want your data to stick around, and then you just plop data in, and once the time expires, it gets removed. It's
          much faster than a typical database because 1. by nature there's less data than if you implemented this in a database, and 2. the data is stored in memory instead
          of on disk.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember on a previous project I worked on a few years ago we had a table that persisted some data, and then a cron job that would clean it up every hour.
          It was a pain because sometimes the cron job wouldn't run correctly or would encounter errors, and we'd need to manually clean it up (in retrospect, a quicker fix 
          would have been to just fix the job, but you know how refactoring gets prioritized sometimes ;)). Had we used a memory based caching system instead, we would
          have been able to not worry about cleaning the table up, our code would have been cleaner (memcached is insanely simple to consume as a developer), and on top
          of all that, it would have been faster!
        </p>
        <p>
          There are plenty of excellent alternatives, such as <a href="https://redis.io/">redis</a> and <a href="http://www.alachisoft.com/ncache/">NCache</a>
          as well, but it just so happens that we use memcached in our stack at Ping, and I thought it was a pretty cool way to improve performance and make life easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next time you find yourself designing something and feel like the data doesn't really need to stick around very long, 
          or find the same data is being read multiple times from a table in a short period of time, I'd definitely recommend giving one of
          these caching tools a try!
