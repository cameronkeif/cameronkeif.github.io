        <h2>October 28 2020 - Higher-Order Components</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever been writing a React component and thought to yourself, "Wow, I sure have seen this about 8 times now..."
        </p>
        <p>
            If so, you're not alone. The nature of React and the front-end ecosystem in general makes it difficult to abstract code out.
            Maybe this is just me coming from a full-stack background where I work in Java a lot, but it's just so much more natural to
            use base classes, interfaces, etc. in an OOP environment. And DANG! It's so great when it's done right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter Higher-Order Components in the React world. You do know that <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#should-i-use-hooks-classes-or-a-mix-of-both">
            class-based components are like, so 2000 and late now, right?</a> Pretending JavaScript (and by extension the React framework) is an Object-Oriented environment
            is not ideal. Sure, there are classes in JS, but ultimately modern JS is better described as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In a functional programming paradigm (and, I guess also mathematics...), a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher-order function</a> is simply a function
            that does one or more of the following:
            <ul>
                <li>takes in a function as at least one of its arguments</li>
                <li>returns a function</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            So given that, both

            <pre>
                const foo = (bar) => bar(1); // bar is a function argument (case 1)
            </pre>

            and

            <pre>
                const bar = () => { alert('baz'); }

                const foo = () => bar; // foo returns a function `bar` (case 2)
            </pre>

            are both higher-order functions!
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if we operate under the idea that our components are also functions, it stands to reason that a higher-order component is simply a component that
            takes in a component, and/or returns a component. In practice, it is usually both. But... Why?
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll leave it up to the solid example provided by the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html">React docs</a> for an example
            rather than pretending to write my own clean example that probably wouldn't transpile anyway, but basically the point here is we can, much like a base
            class in an OOP paradigm, abstract code common between multiple components into a higher-level component. This allows us to reuse code, keep our components
            small, clean, and sticking to their job, and makes it easier to implement similar components in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            In closing, higher-order components are really just higher-order functions. It's a way of generating a component from a component, given a certain pattern.
            You can add this to your toolbox next time you refactor a ton of components that are operating on the same object, or listening to the same browser events, etc.
            to make your code much cleaner and easier to maintain.
