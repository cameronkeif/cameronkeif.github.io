            Welcome to my website! My name is Cameron Keif. I am a professional software developer with eight years of experience currently living in
            Ann Arbor, MI. I am originally from the Detroit, MI area and graduated from Michigan State University in 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm experienced with many frameworks and programming languages. In my current day to day, I work a lot with React/Redux on the frontend,
            as well as Java/Spring and Cassandra on the backend. I also have prior experience with PHP, C#, MySQL, and a variety of other technologies.
            All that said, I always strive to learn more and experiment with new languages and frameworks.
            Have a look at my <a href='projects.html'>projects page</a> and my <a href="https://www.github.com/cameronkeif">Github</a>
            to see what I've been up to.
