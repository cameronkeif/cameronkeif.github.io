	<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Cameron Keif. I am a professional software developer of four years currently living in Austin, TX.</p>
    <p>I'm experienced with many frameworks and programming languages, and I always strive to learn more (check out my <a href='projects.html'>projects page</a> and my <a href="https://www.github.com/cameronkeif">Github</a> to see what I've been up to.)</p>
    <p>Lately in my career I've been focused a bit more on the front end side of things, but I still have the knowledge and skills to do full stack and back end development. I love making applications pretty, but I also love writing blazingly fast algorithms and database queries</p>
    <p>Throughout my career, I've been doing mostly web development with a little Android mixed in. While I love the web space, I could easily see myself transitioning to a different area in the future. I'm a flexible person who genuinely loves writing code and solving problems regardless of the platform</p>
    <p>Please click any of the links above to learn more about me</p>
    <p>A full copy of my resume can be downloaded <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
