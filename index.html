            Welcome to my website! My name is Cameron Keif. I am a professional software developer with five years of experience currently living in
            Austin, TX. I am originally from the Detroit, MI area and graduated from Michigan State University in 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
            I currently work at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com">Ping Identity</a> doing full stack web development on an authentication platform.
            I am always involved in our team's UI work, but I also contribute a lot to the user management and authentication/OAuth APIs.
            For more about what we do at Ping, check out
            <a href="https://www.builtinaustin.com/2018/01/12/working-at-ping-identity-engineers">this interview</a> I was involved in with Built In Austin
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm experienced with many frameworks and programming languages. In my current day to day, I work a lot with React/Redux on the frontend,
            as well as Java/Spring and Cassandra on the backend. I also have prior experience with PHP, C#, MySQL, and a variety of other technologies.
            All that said, I always strive to learn more and experiment with new languages and frameworks.
            Have a look at my <a href='projects.html'>projects page</a> and my <a href="https://www.github.com/cameronkeif">Github</a>
            to see what I've been up to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lately in my career I've been focused a bit more on the front end side of things, but I definitely have the knowledge and skills to do full stack 
            and back end development. I love making applications pretty, but I also love writing blazingly fast algorithms and database queries.
